cookiecutter-django
=======================

A cookiecutter_ template for Django.

.. _cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter

Description
-----------

Lighter version of the Daniel Greenfeld's cookiecutter-django.

It uses the latest stable versions and it only defines a skeleton which can be extended as needed.

Usage
------

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "redditclone". Rather than using `startproject`
and then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get cookiecutter_ to do all the work.

First, get cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter  https://github.com/marcofucci/cookiecutter-django.git

You'll be prompted for some questions, answer them, then it will create a Django project for you.


**Warning**: After this point, change 'Daniel Greenfeld', 'pydanny', etc to your own information.

It prompts you for questions. Answer them::

    full_name (default is "Your full name here")? Daniel Greenfeld
    email (default is "you@example.com")? pydanny@gmail.com
    project_name (default is "dj-project")? redditclone
    app_name (default is "djproject")? redditclone
    project_short_description (default is "Your project description goes here")? A reddit clone.
    release_date (default is "2013-08-15")? 2013-08-15
    year (default is "2013")? 2013
    version (default is "0.1.0")? 0.3.0

Enter the project and take a look around::

    $ cd redditclone/
    $ ls

Create a GitHub repo and push it there::

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first awesome commit!"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:pydanny/redditclone.git
    $ git push -u origin master

Now take a look at your repo. Awesome, right?

It's time to write the code!!!
